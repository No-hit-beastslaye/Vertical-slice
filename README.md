# Vertical-slice 2

Main repo; https://github.com/ThomasGITH/Mythe---project

In this repository, you could find the code that I wrote for the project.

This project had 3 sprints in total, each being 2 weeks long. It's also been made in a team of 4 developers and 2 artists.

# 1st Sprint

As soon as the project started, we started thinking of ideas for what we could make. Out of the few ideas that we had, 2 of the ideas stood out a bit. One was a MMO type of game, the other a stealth game. We voted and unanimously agreed to do the stealth game over the MMO game. 

We immidiately got to work, and thought of ideas on what the setting would be, and what we would need in order to make a finished product. We wrote all of our ideas for that on a wipe board, and everyone chose their respective part of the game that they would work on. I chose the crouching part of the game, a simple, but still a required part of the game. It didn't take long before I finished it, but I finetuned it well enough to not instantly go into crouch mode. 

We ran into some communication problems during development, but we managed to figure out how to solve these issues. Thanks to this, we started daily stand ups at the start of everyday.

At the end of this sprint, we evaluated what all of us had done in those weeks, to reflect back on what's done, what could be better, or what's still in the making.

# 2nd Sprint

We started this sprint pretty normally, we did a daily standup and asked what all of us wanted to accomplish in this sprint.
