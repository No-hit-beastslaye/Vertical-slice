Main repo; https://github.com/sedzjad/VerticalSlice2

Genre; Stealth.

Platform: PC.

In this repository, you could find the code that I wrote for the project.

This project had 3 sprints in total, each being 2 weeks long. It's also been made in a team of 4 developers and 2 artists.

# 1st Sprint

As soon as the project started, we started thinking of ideas for what we could make. Out of the few ideas that we had, 2 of the ideas stood out a bit. One was a MMO type of game, the other a stealth game. We voted and unanimously agreed to do the stealth game over the MMO game. 

We immidiately got to work, and thought of ideas on what the setting would be, and what we would need in order to make a finished product. We wrote all of our ideas for that on a wipe board, and everyone chose their respective part of the game that they would work on. I chose the crouching part of the game, a simple, but still a required part of the game. It didn't take long before I finished it, but I finetuned it well enough to not instantly go into crouch mode. 

We ran into some communication problems during development, but we managed to figure out how to solve these issues. Thanks to this, we started daily stand ups at the start of everyday.

At the end of this sprint, we evaluated what all of us had done in those weeks, to reflect back on what's done, what could be better, or what's still in the making.

# 2nd Sprint

We started this sprint pretty normally, we did a daily standup and asked what all of us wanted to accomplish in this sprint. Since I finished the crouch mechanic of the game, I decided to work on the audio aspect of the game.

This sprint didn't involve any big problems, besides some frustration with the engine and merging errors.

In this sprint, we also did another evaluation about what we did in this sprint, and what we have and wanted to accomplish.

# 3rd Sprint

In the last sprint we focussed on polishing the bigger things in the game, AI, Sound, and the Environment. The more we continued in this sprint, the more problems arose, both in the group and the project itself. Communications started to get a bit less clear, and merging errors started becoming a bigger problem again. 

In the end of the project, we got half of a product, but one that functions.

# Reflection

Even though we had an unfinished product, most of the back end scripting was done, but some of the art was missing, this was because our main artist had the wrong version of Unity, so importing some of the art prefabs that had transparancy or a light effect were heaving a lot of issues. The same thing with pivot points. This made me realise that it's always a neccesity to always start of a project where everyone downloads the same version of the engine, or program.

It also made me realise to try and check in more then once per day to see how something is going, and to see how they're doing. If they're getting frustrated, or relaxing, etc etc.

Furthermore, thanks to this project, I realised that I need to get more used to using Trello, and to update it as soon as I finish something, and acknowledge it in the group, so that I can help other people with their tasks, or receive a new one.
